#Questions for a Race Promoter

### Requirements
We should ask for something that other racers would be interested to know, not something that is obvious or can be find in Google. We also need to get a vision on the following: 

* What it takes to organize a race (to build empathy of other racers)
* What motivates promoters to do what they do
* What are the challenges they face

Questions should be in the order we are going to ask them. Preliminary results should be posted here, under `Interview/Results` folder.
