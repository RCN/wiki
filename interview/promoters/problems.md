# Known problems for promoters
Scheduling is a complex process and [this thread](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/NCNCA-promoters/conversations/messages/692) illustrates some of the issues:



> 1.  Bloated calendar with too many races for too few racers.
2.  Slow encroachment of low effort, low cost criteriums and circuit races taking registrations from higher cost, higher effort Road and Stage races.
The San Jose Bicycle Club has run the Mt. Hamilton road race for years at a loss.  It is also a massive amount of effort to put on requiring permits across 2 cities, 3 counties, UC Santa Cruz (Lick), Caltrans, and the Alum Rock School District.   The cost is already significant before even adding CHP, EMT's, officials, motos, postcards, prizes, etc, etc.   

>But the loss has been somewhat manageable to date (< $2000 typically) , so we've continued to put it on.  But I expect with the additional races added to the same weekend this year (even if they are 2+ hours away) that we will see even more of a loss this year.  If so, we will have to seriously consider canceling this classic race.  Which would be extremely sad after 57 years.....
If we don't do something (and quick), we'll have a calendar like the SCNCA soon (95% crits and short circuit races).

>Lee, we had $30, 000 in sponsorship in cash and free media from Budweiser here locally, and we have been trying to bring back the Visalia Criterium for a few years now, so finding a weekend where we don't trample other races was really tough.  We struggled and changed dates, etc.  Essentially our decision was to pull the Crit riders to our event and allow the road racers to do Mt. Hamilton.  Mt. Hamilton has a 20 mile climb and not many crit riders are going to do that, so that was our best option.  As it is,  we're going to lose a lot of riders to Nationals as we didn't anticipate Nats being in May, but scheduling to match up with SoCal and NorCal is a real challenge and this date was our best option.  But I understand your frustrations.  In SoCal, they have 1 race per weekend usually.  And their attendance is pretty amazing.   Yes, mostly crits but that's because there just isn't any road race courses geographically for them.   NorCal is saturated with races and race series.   Like Chris Lotts down south, some of these guys do this as a business.  I'm not going to knock Steve or Keith, but their races take up a ton of calendar space.  We have 1 weekend to chose out of almost nothing available.  Maybe a better solution is to have a scheduling guru help us all coordinate dates.  Just a thought.
