# Why we do that

We tried to analyze how racers plan their racing season. Right now there is no good tool: 
- to look up all information about races, location and estimate driving time, 
- to compare this with their usual life events 
- to send this information to a coach
- share it with their team 

So we asked how people usually do that.
