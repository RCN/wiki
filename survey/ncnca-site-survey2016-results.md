funny:

Culling of races that are not happening/cancelled. "
It's all there. Look and feel is outdated.

Easier way to find race series , i.e. Ncnca women's series races and standings
I've grown used to the site over the years. I remember it being very difficult to understand in the beginning.
Missing rider comments and questions. A social networking posts like pictures, links to photographers, etc  - - Adam Martin
nothing missing, but confusing to navigate
Don't need to show every day of the month if they're blank.. A big flat list would do, I think.
Every presenter needs to list a Race Flyer (.pdf) on NCNCA calendar.  A link to their website homepage is insufficient.

Better map links
none
Other usacycling rides


Clarity and ability to sync 

The information is technically all there, it's just a beast to find it and it doesn't look particularly good. BAR/BAT, Premier Series, etc details are hard to find unless you know where to look.
"From Schedule -> All Events by Year there is no obvious way to get the calendar view.

The calendar view could scroll to always show at least the next two weeks, even across moths."


Cat
Larger fonts
link to photos for each race, better links to track and cross races

Demographics of current racer by cat needed for sponsor info. 
EASIER TO GET LINK TO OFFICIAL'S WIKI

Mountain and cross calendar is incomplete. No gravel races. Should have races in Oregon Washington and So Cal



The information is there, however, the site needs a face-lift.
The calendar is good. Not much more needed. Perhaps better course descriptions (but that is race directors I am sure.) Maybe location of race on Calendar. Quick link to who is reged?

more photos

Mtb, track events.. or least more of them
Calendar is OK but it would be nice to look at more than one month at a time. 
The ability to send to the apple calendar and to print it


I find it very cumbersome to use. Too many clicks to get to where I want to go (especially to see event details), and it's frustrating that the details open in the same tab.
Visual design.
