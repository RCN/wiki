Ease of use

History/Archiving, search functionality, course info

In the past the ncnca calendar was on Google, so I could copy race events to my personal Google calendar, which was really nice.

none
Reminders for pre-reg deadlines. Quicker access to race flyers and start times. 

None
Mountain Bike Races - needs more info.
being able to filter based on distance from a zip/location. Filtering also for certain events based on a search criteria. Say I wanted to only show races with a field for 3/4 and 4 so I could race twi
Swipe months
Nothing, its all there if you look deep enough.  Clicking through 2 pages isn't a big inconvenience for me.

Direct link of it's own to photograhers. Its under Blogs I think now...really?
Intuitiveness. 
Distance from personal zip code. Series the race belongs to.
Format is relatively useful and pragmatic, export function would be nice.  Main thing is cleaning up the site, there are links to things like the "MTB Calendar" which has not been updated since 2014
No comment
Address listings for each event.  Very helpful for today's GPS society.
Track Event details 


Mobile experience. Accurate start location google maps links.
XC racing.
Nothing 

Events for women only?  :)
User friendliness mainly with better graphics/icons. There have been occasions where the links weren't working on race info, or there wasn't a link for a particular race.  Also, a page for photographr
Would like to have access to flyers throughout the year for planning my races
Exact location of some races to input into GPS/ nav

I think most all the information I need is available in the calendar.  The only thing I think could maybe be improved is the look & feel but this is more cosmetic than anything.

I would like to see the entire calendar without having to hit the >> to cycle through the months.  Just give me a page with the remaining months of the year displayed.  
Could be easier to use, especially on mobile devices. Quick pop up info on races would be good. 
Mobile / phone view
It would be cool if distance to events could be shown.
Opening to the calendar on the NCNCA homepage; a tab to toggle between Cal view and list view (I always forget list view is available below the Cal view). A mobile friendly site/interface PLEASE!
Poor mobile layout
All the info is there, it's just not well organized.
In general, it looks like a '95 website - responsive design and a usability overhaul, simplified, etc.
It would be nice to be able to see all the events at the same time rather than having to look under Mtn Bike for those races or Track for those.
Having the direct link to the registration page for the race, rather than just the domain name and then having to search for it.  I'd also like to see a mobile ready version.

"> calendar is hard to export from.
> Calendar should include unsanctioned events (Grasshoppers, Super  Pro etc.)
> Calendar should link to reg site directly. No need for info page on NCNCA site"
Mtb
Nothing
Cyclocross racing
"Accurate dates/times. 
Links to race websites or registration websites. 
Culling of races that are not happening/cancelled. "
It's all there. Look and feel is outdated.

Easier way to find race series , i.e. Ncnca women's series races and standings
I've grown used to the site over the years. I remember it being very difficult to understand in the beginning.
Missing rider comments and questions. A social networking posts like pictures, links to photographers, etc  - - Adam Martin
nothing missing, but confusing to navigate
Don't need to show every day of the month if they're blank.. A big flat list would do, I think.
Every presenter needs to list a Race Flyer (.pdf) on NCNCA calendar.  A link to their website homepage is insufficient.

Better map links
none
Other usacycling rides


Clarity and ability to sync 

The information is technically all there, it's just a beast to find it and it doesn't look particularly good. BAR/BAT, Premier Series, etc details are hard to find unless you know where to look.
"From Schedule -> All Events by Year there is no obvious way to get the calendar view.

The calendar view could scroll to always show at least the next two weeks, even across moths."


Cat
Larger fonts
link to photos for each race, better links to track and cross races

Demographics of current racer by cat needed for sponsor info. 
EASIER TO GET LINK TO OFFICIAL'S WIKI

Mountain and cross calendar is incomplete. No gravel races. Should have races in Oregon Washington and So Cal



The information is there, however, the site needs a face-lift.
The calendar is good. Not much more needed. Perhaps better course descriptions (but that is race directors I am sure.) Maybe location of race on Calendar. Quick link to who is reged?

more photos

Mtb, track events.. or least more of them
Calendar is OK but it would be nice to look at more than one month at a time. 
The ability to send to the apple calendar and to print it


I find it very cumbersome to use. Too many clicks to get to where I want to go (especially to see event details), and it's frustrating that the details open in the same tab.
Visual design.
