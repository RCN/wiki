# Comparing Zoca and NCNCA results

Both surveys gave us very similar results, but the NCNCA one has more information.
Majority in our survey are `cat 4` and `cat 3`. And 50% of them are older than 45.

### Season Planning
Majority of racers are planing their season for a long period in the **beginning of a season**. They care about their **peak events**. They need it for themselves, teammates and a coach.

### Importance of Event attribues
Surprisingly, both surveys indicated that racers don't think that **race start time** is important. It took 7th place out of 8 (6 out of 7 in the NCNCA). Things of top interest are **race type**, **how far race away** and **if they liked it in the past**.

###Current tools for planning
Racers use spreadsheets, training peaks, Google calendar or just text notes to  plan their season.

###Conclusion
Both surveys indicate that racers care about event details and use them to plan their season. They need to match the plan with training, team, coach and their life. It seems that a lot of time is spent for planning, even though we didn't ask about it.
