# Conclusion

Majority of racers **do plan their season** for a long period, mostly at the beginning of season. They need it for teammates, coach and to better plan life around racing.
Interesting, that survey indicated that racers don't think that race start time is somewhat important. It took 7th place out of 8. Instead, most important attributes are **event type**, **distance to drive** and whether they **liked it in the past**.
Racers don't have any special tools for planing, use spreadsheets, training peaks or just text files.
