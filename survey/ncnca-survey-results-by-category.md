# Conclusion
All categories **planning their races for** themselves and for knowing teammates mostly, but 3s think that letting know to their coach is really important too. **Cat 1/Pro and 5s** marked 20% importance only.

All categories **start planing events** at the beginning of season, but **Cat 5** planing it when they have a chance as well.

All categories can plan their season for **several months** only, but cat 5 is planning for 1 months mostly, and cat 2 can plan for **full season** mostly.

Cat 1/PRO chose the **race popularity** as the most important criteria. But since it's 5 people only we can ignore this difference. And only then **if they liked it** and **Type** go, but for others it's the most important criteria.

All cat 1/Pro plan peak events, but other categories plan it as well (around 80% of people).

In general survey shows differences in votes in different categories as expected. The most experienced racers work on plan in more detailed manner and more frequently.
