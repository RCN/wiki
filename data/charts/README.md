HTML chart for 2014 demographics of USA cycling

In this [issue](https://github.com/Restuta/rcn.io/issues/12) we have stats for:
- [ ] total teams in CA
- [ ] active teams in CA ("active" is a team with more that 0 points)
- [ ] active teams in CA by year (to see trends, simple chart would be nice)
- [ ] active teams in USA (links only)
